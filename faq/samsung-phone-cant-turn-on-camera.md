# Samsung phone can't turn on camera

### While using a Smasung device, the camera cannot be turned on when doing KYC authentication on the Samsung browser.

There may be a problem with the permissions that allow the browser to use the camera.

Please try the following:

* _Settings->Apps->Samsung Internet->Permissions->Camera, select "Allow only while using the app" (if there is no problem with the settings, please continue to the next step)._
* _Clear history on the Samsung browser._
* _Kill the Samsung browser process and try it again._
