# Failed to use the ID card photos taken by the local gallery for authentication

#### Why does the ID photo taken in the local gallery always prompt that the authentication failed?



Please ensure that the ID photo is taken on a horizontal screen.

Currently, compatibility with vertical screens is low.

The recognition rate is higher when the ID photo is directly taken during authentication.&#x20;

Please follow the rules for taking ID photos before starting the authentication.
