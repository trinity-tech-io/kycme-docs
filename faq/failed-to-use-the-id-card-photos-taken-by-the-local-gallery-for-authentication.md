# Failed to use the ID card photos taken by the local gallery for authentication

#### Why does the ID photo taken in the local gallery always prompt that the authentication failed?

* _Please ensure that the ID photo is taken on a horizontal screen. (Currently, verification compatibility with vertical screens is low.)_
* _The recognition rate is higher when the ID photo is taken during authentication._&#x20;
* _Please follow the guidelines for taking ID photos before starting authentication._
