# Elastos DID failed to sign in to kyc

#### Why is the DID sign in unsuccessful, prompting me to publish my identity?



DID can be successfully signed in on KYC-me after it is published on the chain.

Under normal circumstances, DID will be automatically published on the chain after it is created.&#x20;

If DID is not published successfully due to network or service, please manually publish it on the chain.

If the DID has been published successfully, but when you try to sign in, it still prompts that you need to publish it on the chain. It may be due to the network, just wait for a few minutes and try again.



_Note:_

The steps to manually publish DID are as follows:
