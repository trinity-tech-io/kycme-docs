# Elastos DID failed to sign in to kyc

#### Why is the DID sign-in unsuccessful, prompting me to publish my identity?

DID can be successfully signed in on KYC-me after it is published on the chain.

Under normal circumstances, DID will be automatically published on the chain after it is created.&#x20;

If DID is not published successfully due to network or service, please manually publish it on the chain.

_**Note:**_

The steps to manually publish DID are as follows:
